description=QGIS plugin to add geospatial data from mongodb database.
about = This plugin allows you to add collection from mongodb as layer in QGIS.
        It requires pymongo>=3.0 python plugin for mongodb access ($pip install pymongo).
        Layer from mongodb collection is created in memory and named after collection
        (with some random numbers). As for now save to database is not supported.
        Please report bugs and suggestions on github issues tracker.
        To use it just click connect button. Choose database and collection. Finally
        Mark if geometry is like in geojson or pick proper field with geometry.
        If geojson-style than all the geometry types are supported otherwise
        points / lines geometries only. Other data in collection are added as
        feature attributes. Data in "properties" field can be used as data
        if key was found. See examples for details.
